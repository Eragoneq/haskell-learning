# Haskell learning

This repository is a training in a Haskell programming language.

I'm going to go over the main features of the functional programming paradigm and try to incorporate this knowledge in other projects.

Furthermore this repository will try to incorporate some of the Github CI/CD features to do automatic unit testing.

Based on [this](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html) course.

## TODO:
